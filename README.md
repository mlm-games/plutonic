# Plutonic

A suika-like / spuntika-like game that supports pluto's inclusion into our solar system (made in Godot and is OSS)

<!-- (actually though, have no agenda) -->

### How to play

Drag backwards to launch the planet! The harder you drag, the farther it goes.

The game ends if a planet hits another planet, and goes out of the field for 2.5 seconds. Try to not touch with force (only collisions)!
